>This is an **unfinished** profile with additional Spacebar instead of the knob. 

It doesn't use VIA. To configure it:
1. Use [QMK Configurator](https://config.qmk.fm/#/skyloong/gk61/pro_48/LAYOUT_all)
2. Download `keymap.json`
3. Run `qmk json2c keymap.json` to convert to `LAYOUT_*` macro definitions.

### Why is it unfinished?

Because of an unfortunate switch pinhole layout in the lower row, I couldn't properly align my DCS keycaps. Perhaps, some other keycap profile will do...
